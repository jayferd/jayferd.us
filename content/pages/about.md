title: About Me
---

I'm a [programmer][github], a musician, and a student of nonviolence.

**NOTICE**: I will never work for (or "informally connect with") any company unless it is a) a place where a good friend of mine works, or b) is using one of my open-source projects, or c) has a strong social-justice mission.  To save everyone time and emails, if you represent a company and email me for any reason, please explain why your company fits one of these conditions.  **Any emails failing to do this will be marked as spam, no questions asked.**

## Code I've written
* [parsimmon][]
  Originally written as part of MathQuill, Parsimmon is a monadic parser combinator
  library for javascript.  Written jointly with [Han Wei][].
* [rouge][]
  A syntax highlighter for Ruby, whose output is compatible with Pygments stylesheets.
* [mathquill][]
  gui editable math in the browser.  This is a joint project with my good friend [Han Wei][].  Also, awesomesauce.
* [pjs](http://github.com/jneen/pjs)
  Classes for Javascript that you'd actually use.  Basically it's prototypes with the bad parts taken out.
* [ry][], the simplest possible virtual environments for Ruby

All of these projects are supported on a volunteer-basis.  If you use any of these and would like to contribute, I accept tips through Gittip.  Thanks!
