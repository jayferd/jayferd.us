title: About Me
---

I'm a [hacker][github], a systems engineer, a musician, and a student of nonviolence.

**NOTICE**: I'm currently traveling in Europe, and I am **not** currently looking for a job.  I also will never work for (or "informally connect with") any company unless it is a) a place where a good friend of mine works, or b) is using one of my open-source projects, or c) has a strong social-justice mission.  To save everyone time and emails, if you represent a company and cold-email me for any reason, please explain why your company fits one of these conditions.  **Any emails failing to do this will be marked as spam, no questions asked.**
